# scrambler
Scrambler is the original discord bot created for generating scrambles for twisty puzzles.
This project uses [Scrambo](https://github.com/nickcolley/scrambo) for some scrambles, and Redi Cube scrambles are provided by xyzzy, sourced [here](https://torchlight.github.io/rediscrambler.js). All other scrambles and commands were written by the scrambler dev team. 

## How to add the bot:
Simply click [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=423530119836073986&permissions=130048&scope=bot) and select the server you would like to add it to! Scrambler is hosted on a dedicated server monitored by [ecuber](https://github.com/ecuber/). Make sure scrambler has permission to read and send messages in the channels you want to use it in.

## How to get started:
Once you add the bot to your server, simply run `s!help` for a list of all of the currently available commands. For the basic twisty puzzles, you can just run `s!<puzzle name>` (without the brackets). All officially recognized WCA events are featured currently, and other puzzles included can be found in the help command.

Scrambler has multiple useful tools for managing the use of the bot on your server. You can a choose a convenient prefix with `s!prefix`, and restrict the use of the bot in certain channels with `s!ignore`. The ignore command has many helpful arguments which can be viewed by running `s!ignore help`.
